# **Competition : Marketing campaign optimization**
**==========================================================================**


### **Context of the project**

Your company operates a chain of retail stores across Russia specializing in the sale of a wide range of alcoholic beverages. Recently, a wine promotion conducted in Saint Petersburg proved to be highly successful. However, due to budgetary constraints, it is not feasible to extend the promotion to all regions simultaneously. The marketing team aims to identify 10 additional regions with consumer buying patterns comparable to those observed in Saint Petersburg, where the promotion is likely to achieve similar success.


### **The data**

The marketing team has sourced you with historical sales volumes per capita for several different drinks types.

* **"year"** - year (1998-2016).
* **"region"** - name of a federal subject of Russia. It could be oblast, republic, krai, autonomous okrug, federal city and a single autonomous oblast.
* **"wine"** - sale of wine in litres by year per capita.
* **"beer"** - sale of beer in litres by year per capita.
* **"vodka"** - sale of vodka in litres by year per capita.
* **"champagne"** - sale of champagne in litres by year per capita.
* **"brandy"** - sale of brandy in litres by year per capita.

**Note :** The version of the dataset used in this dataset is a poisoned dataset, which means that a certain part of the data have been lost.


### **Summary of this project :**

1) **Initialization :** This part covers the study of the dataset structure and caracteristics, and its preparation.
2) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :** In this part, we will try to understand what informations the dataset contains.
3) **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) :** Once the knowledge of the dataset obtained, we can try to have a relative visual representation of the regions's alcohol consumption.
4) **Region Segmentation :** This part covers the most important process of this project : we will uncover the regions that have an alcohol consumption that matches Saint Petersburg's.
5) **Final Recommandations :** Finally, a synthetic presentation of the results obtained from the previous steps.
